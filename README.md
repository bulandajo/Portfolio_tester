# My Tester's Protfolio

## About me
My name is Joanna Bulanda. I work as a Quality Analyst and recently I started to be interested in software testing.
In my current job, attention to detail, accuracy and thorough knowledge of the client's requirements are very important. I am also organized and can persistently look for solutions to problems. I believe that these traits will be useful in the tester's work.
My goal is to develop testing knowledge and technical skills. On this page I would like to share my experiences gained through my own study and research.
